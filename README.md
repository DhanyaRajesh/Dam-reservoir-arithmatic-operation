# Dam-reservoir-arithmatic-operation
A dam reservoir's capacity is 250e100 cubic meter where it holds 199.5e85 cu.m water. A rain occurred in the area which gave 25e8 cu.m water but 25% amount of this rain water ran-off useless. The remaining water from this rainfall flowed to the reservoir and there it was collected. On another day, a heavy storm increased the water level of this dam to its 15% of the current water level. Ground water sources contributed 5% to reservoir's current level. 5% of the present level of reservoir evaporated and later 15% amount of water was passed for irrigation to arid regions.

Task
Write a python program using less number of lines of code to find the current water level of the reservoir using the given data?
